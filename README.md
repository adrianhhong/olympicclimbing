# Olympic Sports Climbing Scores

Graphing out the chance of winning a medal, based on your score for the Olympic Sports Climbing finals.

I like bouldering and I enjoyed watching sports climbing appear in the Olympics for the first time in Tokyo 2020. I wanted to find out what your chance of getting a medal was based on what score you got for the 3 disciplines.
This graphs out the chances using `Chart.js` and `Vue.js`.

Inspired by [this Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/oxxdrb/was_wondering_what_is_the_max_combined_ranking/?ref=share&ref_source=link).

## Installation

To setup locally:

```bash
  cd olympicclimbing
  npm install
  npm run serve
```

## Further Work

I also want to look into the multiplicative scoring method that was present in the Olympics and compare it to other forms of scoring such as addititve or the scoring system of F1.
